# tracKreature #
### A program for reporting, tracking, and understanding species ###

## Purpose ##

tracKreature is a database and website that allows users to input data about species to create population data.  It can be used to generate maps, keep track of population movements, pests, endangered animals, etc.  

## Future ideas ##

1. App integration
2. Easy identification based on a nested tree of physical characteristics navigated by swiping.
3. Expand this to other types of data - this can be used to track any population data over space and time.
